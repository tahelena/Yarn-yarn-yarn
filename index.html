            <p>There are a wide variety of fibers that are used to create yarns that you can use for knitting
                and crocheting and they come from a variety of sources. Yarns are made from a group of fibers
                twisted together to form a continuous strand. The fibers used to create these yarns include
                animal fibers, plant fibers and synthetic fibers. There are benefits and negatives for each
                type of fiber and yarn, but with such a wide variety youâ€™re sure to find the perfect fit
                for your project.</p>

            <h2>Animal Fiber Based Yarns Include Wool, Silk And Cashmere.</h2>
            <h3>Alpaca Fiber</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tahelena/image/upload/v1552299817/Yarn%20Project/949f13c1df30a468b76afab5b994011b_XL.jpg"
                alt="Alpacas">
            <p>Alpaca fiber is similar to sheep's wool and is another natural, animal fiber. It's harvested from
                Alpaca's and while similar to sheep's wool, does have different characteristics. It contains no
                lanolin making it hypoallergenic and it's warmer than sheep's wool. Alpaca yarn was first used
                in the early 1800's in England though it took some effort for it to become a workable material.
                This was because the yarn was being woven into a camlet type fabric which didn't work well with
                the alpaca yarn. Once the warp and weft method was introduced, alapca yarn was able to be
                woven into a successful fabric.</p>
            <h3>Sheep's Wool</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tahelena/image/upload/v1552302262/Yarn%20Project/Sheep_eating_grass_edit02.jpg"
                alt="Sheeps">
            <p>There are a few different varieties of sheep's wool depending on the breed of the sheep the wool
                is coming from. The two most common types of sheep's wool are merino and lopi with merino being
                the most common and prized type of sheep's wool.</p>
            <h3>Silk From Silkworms</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tahelena/image/upload/v1552299880/Yarn%20Project/1434627373796791.jpg"
                alt="Silkworms">
            <p>Silk is produce by insect larvae so that they can form cocoons. Bombyx mori, also known as
                Mulberry silkworms, produce the most wildely known form of silk but for textile manufacturing,
                moth caterpillars are generally the one type used.</p>

            <h2>Plant Fiber Based Yarns Include Hemp, Cotton And Bamboo.</h2>
            <h3>Hemp</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tahelena/image/upload/v1552299911/Yarn%20Project/69895521-marijuana-leafs-on-top-of-dried-hemp-fibers.jpg"
                alt="Hemp Fiber">
            <p>Hemp fiber has been a commonly used fiber for centuries. In addition to yarn, hemp fibers can be
                used for fabrics and textiles, rope, and even food. Hemp has a great deal of benefits as it
                can grow much more quickly than trees and requires less water and no pesticides or fertilizers.</p>
            <h3>Cotton</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tahelena/image/upload/v1552299943/Yarn%20Project/CottonPlant.jpg"
                alt="Cotton Fiber">
            <p>Cotton is a very popular source for thread and textile manufacturing with a variety of types
                that can be grown and used. The 3 most popular types of cotton used for yarn manufacturing
                are Egyptian cotton, Pima cotton and American cotton. Each have their own benefits over the
                other. Egyptian cotton is the longest cotton fiber and is softer than the other types of
                cotton. American cotton is available the widest amount of colors thanks to it being able
                to take dye better than other types of cotton. Pima cotton is a mixture between Egyptian
                and American cotton with properties of both. </p>
            <h3>Bamboo</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tahelena/image/upload/v1552299976/Yarn%20Project/bamboo-fibers.jpg"
                alt="Bamboo fiber">
            <p> Bamboo fibers are generally too short to be used to create a natural fiber, but bamboo bast
                can be used in combination with a chemical process to create rayon which is synthetic fiber.
                The environmental benefits of bamboo still are valid as they can be harvested without
                killing the plant, are a carbon sink, they produce oxygen and they control soil erosion.
                The main environmental benefit of bamboo is that it can grow and spread quickly without
                much use of water, pesticides or fertilizers.</p>

            <h2>Synthetic Fiber Base Yarns Include Nylon, Polyester And Rayon.</h2>
            <h3>Rayon</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tahelena/image/upload/v1552300014/Yarn%20Project/1200px--Rayon_synthesis.webm.jpg"
                alt="Rayon fiber">
            <p>Rayon is a manufactured cellulose fiber that is commonly made from purified cellulose from
                wood and plant pulp. Even though the process starts with a wood or plant pulp, the
                chemical process that it goes through makes a semi-synthetic fiber with no identifiable
                properties of the original natural fiber. The most popular method to create rayon fibers
                is the viscose method. This method was created to create an artificial silk. These days
                many types of natural fibers that can be used to start this process such as hemp pulp
                or bamboo pulp. Even though these fibers are used in the process, the final product
                can't be considered a natural product due to the chemical process that is involved.
                After viscosity the original fibers used can't even be identified. Rayon and viscose
                are interchangable terms within the US and both can be used to label the same final
                product.</p>
            <h3>Nylon</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tahelena/image/upload/v1552300044/Yarn%20Project/Nylon-triangle-fiber.jpg"
                alt="Nylon fiber">
            <p>Nylon is a very popular synthetic fiber that first was used in 1935. It is commonly used
                for clothing, namely women's stockings, but can also be used for car parts, electrical
                equipment and food packaging films. Nylon was created to be a synthetic replacement for
                silk due to silk becoming scarce during World War II. It was used to manufacturer parachutes,
                flak vests and vehicle tires.</p>
            <h3>Polyester</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tahelena/image/upload/v1552301646/Yarn%20Project/polyester-staple-fibre-447390.jpg"
                alt="Polyester fiber">
            <p>Polyester is another popular type of synthetic fiber and it is mostly used in clothing.
                Polyester is a category of polymer that includes natural chemicals such as the cutin in
                plant cuticles and synethetic chemicals. Natural based polyesters are biodegradable
                but most synthetic ones are not. Polyester thread can be used to create fabrics that
                are used in clothing, furniture and linens and even items such a mousepads. Polyester
                can also be blended with natural fibers such as cotton which can change the properties of
                the resulting material. Blended with cotton, polycotton is tear and wrinkle resistant and
                strong. It also helps reduce shrinking.</p>
